## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Less preprocessor

### What I learned

The main thing i learned with this project was how to use forms to change the DOM. This was my first time using forms in any way and it was really interesting to use JavaScript to get the rating given by the user.


### Continued development

I want to keep learning more about JavaScript, it is a really interesting and useful language.
